Implementing BPE in pure C++, what I need to know

Things which are needed to be done here 

- Dictionary of symbol→id (just std::unordered_map<std::string, uint32_t>).
- Reverse map id→symbol (std::vector<std::string>).
- A priority queue or flat map that keeps the current best merge pair -> frequency.

Kind of a workflow which it will follow

- read the training text
- convert to UTF-8 bytes
- split on whitespace to get “words” (each is a sequence of bytes).
